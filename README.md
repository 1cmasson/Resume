# [Welcome](https://carlosmasson.com)
My name is Carlos Masson and this repository is to showcase my personal projects.

# [Who am I?](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-masson-29130a14a/)
I am a Computer Science student with exposure to developing software applications. I graduate in August of 2021 from Florida International University. I have 5 years of work experience in The Home Depot as a merchandising associate and looking to become an engineer for the company. I may provide a beneficial impact to The Home Depot by bringing an knowledge and understanding of what the company's frontline workers do and may need.

# [Bolt](https://github.com/carninojo15/bolt)
Bolt is an application that is supposed to imitate the same software that is used in my job as a Home Depot Merchandising Associate. Bolt is a list that can add, delete, sort, and search for bays in a Home Depot Store.  It sorts and searches for datapoints like bay traffic, last time bay was serviced, time, and bay number. This was made using ReactJS. The second version of this application, [BOLT 2.0](https://github.com/carninojo15/BOLT2.0), was made with a backend using Spring MVC.

# [Portfolio](https://github.com/carninojo15/portfolio-app)
This is my personal website that is used to show my resume, share links to my github and linkedin, display my projects. This application was made using ReactJS

# [COP3530 Assignment 5](https://github.com/carninojo15/COP3530_Assignment-5)
This is an assignment that I have done for my data structures class. The assignment asks you to use Bellman-Ford Algorithm to ﬁnd the most proﬁtable exchange sequence between currencies of diﬀerent countries. It takes an input file "exchange.csv" showing the exchange rates between different currencies. This application was made using Java 

# [Bank Approval ML](https://github.com/carninojo15/BankApprovalML)
This is a project made to understand machine learning by creating a prediction model to predict if a user would be approved for a bank loan or not. The user would fill a form and the application would predict if it would be approved based on trained data. This application was made using Django, Scikit Learn, NumPy, etc.

# [Blockchain](https://github.com/carninojo15/blockchain)
This is a project made to understand how blockchain technology works. The way it works is the application takes inputs from a form and its store into a block of transactions. For the case of the project, the transactions are votes. When the votes are done being stored in the block, the user can then mine the block. Mining is validates the votes in the block, closing the block, then chains the block to the one that was created before it. This what makes a blockchain, blocks of votes being chained together. This application was made using AngularJS

# [Covid-19 Tracker](https://github.com/carninojo15/covid-19-tracker)
The Covid-19 Tracker is an application that is supposed to display a line chart of the global cases of Covid-19, as well as display a histogram of the amount of cases, deaths, and recoveries for each country.The data comes from this open source [api](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api). This project was made using ReactJS.
